Pathfinder for Robot

The assignment involves implementing a simplified path planning algorithm for a 2D robot moving around a room. The 2D environment will be represented as a grid of ASCII characters, with obstacles represented as walls, open spaces represented as dots, the start position of the robot represented as "S", and the goal point that the robot is trying to reach represented as "G". The environment is always surrounded by walls.

The implementation of the path planning algorithm will require using programming skills such as pointers, dynamic memory management, and arrays. The program will be written in C++ using predefined classes and will incorporate specific C++11/14 language features.
